=> Introduction
- Bash is a command interpreter or shell but also has alot of features that makes it a programming Language. 
- A script file has the extension name of 'sh' and the execution permission for the file must be set. And to run a script, we use type "./myScript.sh". 

NB: The extension name is just a practice and not necessary
- The first line of any bash script must starts with the path to the interpreter (it is a practice); "#!/bin/bash".

=> Variables
- To create a variable, we have;
* variableName=value e.g. username = "Adigun Alapomeji". Note that there must not be spaces)
*To reference or print the value of the variable, we precede it with "$" sign e.g "$username"
*NB: Double quotes should be use for string interpolation. For example: 
username="Lanx"
echo "Hello! This is $username."
- Command output can also be parse to variable e.g.

myOutput = $(ls) !where $(ls) is called subshell; subshell allows you to execute command in the background by running the command in the background and gives the output to the variable.  

*Some built-in or environment variables: $PATH, $USER, etc.
* "env" - To output all variables
